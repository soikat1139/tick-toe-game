Project Title

Tick-Tock-Toe Game
Description

The Tick-Tock-Toe Game is a two-player game where players take turns marking X's and O's in a 3x3 grid. The first player to get three marks in a row, column, or diagonal wins the game. If all the cells are filled and no player has achieved the winning condition, then the game is a draw.

The game is implemented in Python programming language and uses the Pygame library for the user interface.
Getting Started

To run the game, you need to have Python and Pygame library installed on your computer. You can install Pygame using the following command:

pip install pygame

Once you have installed Pygame, download or clone this repository to your local machine.

To start the game, open the command prompt or terminal and navigate to the project directory. Run the following command to start the game:

python tick_tock_toe.py

Usage

To play the game, follow these steps:

    The game starts with a blank 3x3 grid.
    Player 1 is assigned 'X' and player 2 is assigned 'O'.
    The first player (X) makes the first move by clicking on an empty cell on the grid.
    The second player (O) makes the next move by clicking on an empty cell on the grid.
    Players take turns making moves until one player wins or the game ends in a draw.
    If a player wins, the game displays a message indicating the winner and the game ends.
    If the game ends in a draw, the game displays a message indicating that the game is a draw and the game ends.
